This post outlines the steps I took to set up my home lab using VMware, from installing virtual machines to configuring the necessary settings.
This lab is inspired by Eric Capuanoâ€™s home lab. Tools used include: VMware, Ubuntu, Windows 10/11, Putty (SSH Client), LimaCharlie (EDR), and Sliver (C2). Some work will be completed using Sysmon, gpedit, IP config, etc.
